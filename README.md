## Conditional Statements

1. Write a Java program that takes a year from the user and print whether that
   year is a leap year or not.


2. Write a Java program to input week number(1-7) and print day of week name
   using switch case.
3.

## Loops

1. Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the
   even and odd integers.

2.

## Arrays

1. Average of Elements of Array.


2. Checking Duplicate Element in an Array.


3. To Find Maximum and Minimum Element of Array.


4. Program to Create a Copy of Array.


5.

## Functions And Methods

1. Write a Java method to compute the average of three numbers..


2. Write a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method
   should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. Also write a program to test your
   method.


3. Write a Java program to check if a number is a palindrome in Java? ( 121 is a
   palindrome, 321 is not)
   A number is called a palindrome if the number is equal to the reverse of a number e.g., 121 is a
   palindrome because the reverse of 121 is 121 itself. On the other hand, 321 is not a
   palindrome because the reverse of 321 is 123, which is not equal to 321.


4. Search about(Google) & use the following methods of the Math class in Java:

* a. Math.min( )
* b. Math.max( )
* c. Math.sqrt( )
* d. Math.pow( )
* e.Math.avg( )
* f. Math.abs( ) <br>

5. Write a Java method to compute the sum of the digits in an integer.
   (Hint : Approach this question in the following way :
   a. Take a variable sum = 0
   b. Find the last digit of the number
   c. Add it to the sum
   d. Repeat a & b until the number becomes 0 )
